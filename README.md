RemixIcon-Slides is a PowerPoint and Keynote version of [remixicon](https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon), a set of open-source neutral-style system symbols. Unlike a patchwork icon library, 1400+ icons are all elaborately crafted so that they are born with the gene of readability, consistency, and perfect pixels. Each icon was designed in "Outlined" and "Filled" styles. Of course, all the icons are free for both personal and commercial use.

This repo is a subproject of [remixicon](https://github.com/Remix-Design/RemixIcon).

## Donate

We love Open Source like you, but it costs enormous time, effort, and passion in product design and updates. It also involves huge work to make 1400+ icons available and editable to PowerPoint and Keynote users. We'll be very grateful if you [buy us a coffee](https://remixicon.com/#donate) and it will greatly encourage us to move on.
